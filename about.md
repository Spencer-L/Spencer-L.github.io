# Modern Renaissance Man

I am a programmer with a strong passion
in combining multiple disciplines to make
innovative and effective creations
ranging from autonomous unmanned aerial
systems that gather plant health data to an
ultra cost-effective V-Mount battery and
cinema equipment.  I am currently
studying to get my BS in CS and a minor
in Interactive Media at the University
of Southern California and will be
graduating in 2024.
