                    Surface Exploration & Navigation Visual Assistant (SENVA)
                    is an AR heads up display built on the HoloLens 2 platform
                    for the NASA SUITS Challenge.  SENVA is intended as a
                    proof of concept to demonstrate expanded capabilities for
                    next-gen spacesuits for lunar/martian exploration by lowering
                    users' cognitive load and improving safety.  SENVA is
                    specifically designed to work in a high risk environment,
                    employing multi-modal input for redundancy, as well as
                    a completely off-cloud NLP powered digital assistant trained
                    on Apollo mission transcripts to understand domain-specific
                    language used in spaceflight operations.  Additional safety
                    features include proximity terrain analysis, dynamic
                    pathfinding, search and rescue capabilities, and a blackbox
                    feature for recording telemetry data.
