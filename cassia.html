                    Cassia is a 2D virtual helper designed to serve as an
                    information kiosk for public events. Users interact
                    with Cassia through a touch screen and voice commands.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    After hosting multiple successful public events for
                    Planet Save, I noticed that there was a 
                    disproportional ratio of visitors to crew members. 
                    That resulted in many visitors leaving our booth 
                    prematurely without ever having the chance to see and 
                    learn about our many environmental projects. 
                    Cassia is designed to remedy that issue by providing 
                    visitors an educational and entertaining interactive
                    experience while they wait to interact with our team.
