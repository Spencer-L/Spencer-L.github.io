                    Estuary is an open-source multimodal framework for building off-cloud low-latency real-time socially interactive agents.
                    It is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform that can be used to create a wide variety of agents, from embodied
                    conversational agents to virtual assistants.  Leveraging an edge computing architecture and integration with both
                    industry-grade and open-source AI models, researchers and developers are afforded the maximum flexibility of which AI models
                    they would like to use without being constrained by hardware architecture incompatibilities or the limitations of cloud computing.
                    Furthermore, as an open-source project, Estuary is designed to be a community-driven project that can be easily extended
                    as well as run completely off-cloud, ensuring user privacy and data security. Finally, integration with Unity gives developers
                    a familiar environment to build their agents in, and the ability to deploy their agents to a wide variety of platforms.
