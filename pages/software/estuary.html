                    Estuary is an open-source multimodal framework for building off-cloud low-latency real-time conversational AI agents.
                    Leveraging an edge computing architecture and integration with open-source AI models, researchers and developers are
                    afforded the maximum flexibility of which AI models they would like to use without being constrained by hardware 
                    architecture incompatibilities or the limitations of cloud computing. Furthermore, as an open-source project, Estuary 
                    is designed to be a community-driven project that can be easily extended as well as run completely off-cloud, ensuring 
                    user privacy and data security. Finally, integration with Unity gives developers a familiar environment to build their 
                    agents in, and the ability to deploy their agents to a wide variety of platforms.
