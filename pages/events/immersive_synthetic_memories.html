                    Was there ever a time you wished you could relive a memory, but you couldn't
                    quite remember it?  Maybe you dug through your phone; perhaps the good 'ol 
                    family photo album... but still nothing.  In these cases, generative AI may
                    be the perfect tool to help recreate those special moments.  But, to take things
                    even further, what if you can completely immerse yourself into that memory
                    to relive it once more as if you were seeing it from the first person? That's
                    where Immersive Synthetic Memories comes in.  This is a project born out of a
                    class I helped teach at the USC School of Cinematic Arts under Professor Scott 
                    Fisher.  By combining a mixture of commercial and open-source AI technologies 
                    with VR headsets, we developed a novel pipeline to generate 180 degrees
                    stereoscopic immersive videos, complete with AI-generated spatial audio.

                <h4 style="text-align: left">The Process</h4>
                <p>
                    We partnered with Barcelona-based company Domestic Data Streamers (DDS)
                    to develop the process of creating these memories.  Previously, DDS specialized
                    in generating 2D synthetic memories using commercially available tools, whereas
                    our lab specialized in XR applications. By combining our expertise, we built a 
                    novel generative AI pipeline and came up with a process that involves a 15 to 20
                    minute interview with the guest, whilst a team of prompters generate the synthetic 
                    memory in real-time.  The guest is then invited to don a VR headset and experience 
                    the memory.  The results were astounding, with many guests reporting the experience 
                    as "uncannily accurate" and "emotionally moving" as you can see in the comparison
                    photo to the left!  More details about our process to come in our upcoming paper!
