                    Surface Exploration & Navigation Visual Assistant (SENVA)
                    is a holographic heads up display built on the HoloLens 2
                    for the 2021 NASA SUITS Challenge.  SENVA is intended as a
                    proof of concept to demonstrate expanded capabilities for
                    NASA's next-gen xEMU suit intended for lunar exploration.
                    Features include proximity terrain analysis, dynamic
                    pathfinding, realtime yellow brick road navigation, an offline
                    NLP digital assistant powered by machine learning, and search
                    and rescue capabilities, and comprehensive telemetry stream
                    from suit sensors for vitals monitoring.
